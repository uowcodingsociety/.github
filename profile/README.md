Welcome to **CodeSoc** - the University of Warwick's biggest programming community!

We're just a bunch of students who think coding is pretty cool and want to share that with everyone else. Whether you've been programming since you were 12 or you're still figuring out what a variable is, you'll fit right in.

## What we're all about

We love coding and want to help other students get into it too.

Uni CS courses are great, but they don't always teach you the stuff you'll actually use in internships or jobs. We fill that gap with workshops on things like React, APIs, mobile development, and whatever else people are interested in (Rust/C++ addicts welcome too).

Plus, coding can feel pretty isolating when you're stuck on a bug at 2am. We're here to change that. Come to our events, join our Discord, find a mentor, or just hang out with people who get excited about the same nerdy stuff you do.

## Join us!

It's completely free and takes about 30 seconds:
ðŸ‘‰ [Sign up on the SU website](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/warwickcodingsociety/)

And in return, we'll give you:

- Dibs on workshop spots (some fill up fast!)
- Access to our mentorship scheme
- Free pizza at events (this is not a joke - we take pizza very seriously)
- A Discord full of people who will actually understand your programming memes
- The chance to build cool projects with other students

## Get a coding buddy (aka Mentorship)

Ever wish you had that friend who just _gets_ programming and can explain why your code keeps breaking? That's basically our mentorship scheme.

We pair up beginners with more experienced students. You'll meet up roughly once a week to:

- Work through problems together (no judgment if you've been staring at the same error for 3 hours)
- Build projects that actually interest you
- Navigate the weird world of programming interviews, internships, and career stuff

Want to be a mentor? Even better! Teaching someone else is honestly one of the best ways to level up your own skills. We'll release this near the start of Term 1 every year!

## Courses, Workshops, Events & Talks

We run a wide variety of sessions throughout the year, including:

- **Student-made free courses** (Python, HTML/CSS, Java, Swift, UI/UX, and more)
- **Hands-on workshops** to apply your skills
- **Guest talks from industry partners** (past: Bloomberg, Amazon, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs)
- **Competitions & hackathons** to challenge yourself
- **Socials** (board games, football, pub trips, etc.)
